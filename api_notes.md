#[Google Knowledge Graph Search API](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/)
- allows developers to search the [Google Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph) for entities
- new ( and incomplete ) API, [released 2015-12](https://plus.google.com/109936836907132434202/posts/iY8NZGFF6DN)
- returns [JSON-LD](https://developers.google.com/schemas/formats/json-ld?hl=en)
- data is organized by [schema.org type](http://schema.org/docs/gs.html#schemaorg_types)
- [reference](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/reference/rest/v1/)

###example GET request:
`https://kgsearch.googleapis.com/v1/entities:search?query=dolores park&key=SERVERKEYGOESHERE&limit=1&indent=True`

###response body:

}
```

###response notes:
- @type is the schema.org type
- a working URL can be built from the `kg` context + the `@id`: http://g.co/kg/m/03zyss
	- this link opens a google search with a knowledge graph-based side bar
	- bottom of the side bar sometimes has a "People also search for" section

#[Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/)
- uses unique [Place IDs](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id)

##[Google Places API Javascript Library](https://developers.google.com/places/javascript/)

- Add places to your map, from within the Google Maps JavaScript API.
- The functions in the Google Places JavaScript library enable your application to search for places (defined in this API as establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of interest) contained within a defined area, such as the bounds of a map, or around a fixed point.
- The Google Places API offers an autocomplete feature which you can use to give your applications the type-ahead-search behavior of the Google Maps search field. When a user starts typing an address, autocomplete will fill in the rest. For more information, see the autocomplete documentation.
- to use, add `libraries=places` to the Google Maps API script URL
- With the Places service you can perform four kinds of searches:
	- Nearby Search returns a list of nearby places based on a user's location.
	- Text Search returns a list of nearby places based on a search string, eg. "Pizza".
	- Radar Search returns a large list of places within a specified search radius, but with less detail than either Nearby Search or Text Search.
	- Place Details requests return more detailed information about a specific place, including user reviews.
- The information returned can include establishments â€” such as restaurants, stores, and offices as well as 'geocode' results, which indicate addresses, political areas such as towns and cities, and other points of interest.




##[Google Places API Web Service](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/)
- Find detailed information about places across a wide range of categories. Backed by the same database used by Google Maps and Google+, the Google Places API Web Service features about 100 million businesses and points of interest that are updated frequently through owner-verified listings and user-moderated contributions. Key features include autocomplete, search, place picker, photos and add place.
- The following place requests are available:
	- Place Searches return a list of places based on a user's location or search string.
	- Place Details requests return more detailed information about a specific Place, including user reviews.
	- Place Add allow you to supplement the data in Google's Places database with data from your application.
	- Place Photos gives you access to the millions of Place related photos stored in Google's Place database.
	- Place Autocomplete can be used to automatically fill in the name and/or address of a place as you type.
	- Query Autocomplete can be used to provide a query prediction service for text-based geographic searches, by returning suggested queries as you type.
- Each of the services is accessed as an HTTP request, and returns either an JSON or XML response. All requests to a Places service must use the https:// protocol, and include an API key.

###example Place search GET request:
`https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?location=37.783, -122.416&radius=500&types=place&name=park&key=SERVERKEYHERE`
